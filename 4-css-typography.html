        <h1>Hi, I'm Maria!</h1>
        <h2>Future operations analyst, writer and aspiring glass-ceiling breaker</h2>
        <p><img src="images/headshot.jpg" width="200" title="Maria" alt="Maria Galindo" align= "left" /> My name is Maria Galindo. I'm a 21-year-old University of Florida student born in Bogota, Colombia. When I was 10, I moved to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, learned English and fell in love with writing.</p>
<p>I moved to Gainesville, Florida in 2010 with dreams of getting my Journalism degree at UF and joining the ranks of the guardians of the first amendment. This all, however, changed when I was forced to take microeconomics as a required elective, and I found my second love – efficiency.  The concept of marginal analysis just made sense to me, so I began exploring the career paths that would allow me to put my intellectual curiosity of efficiency to work.</p>
<p>While I now see myself working in operations rather than in writing, I will always be a writer. In fact, in my free time I write a business <a href="http://www.mariagalindoblog.wordpress.com">blog</a>.  I write about the things I learn and love - management, leadership, economics and finance.</p>
<p>I’m an <a href="http://www.personalitydesk.com/entj">ENTJ</a> and a <a href="http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2010/067/4/7/Gryffindor_by_Tullerusk.png">Gryffindor</a>. When I’m not writing or problem solving, I can likely be found reading, traveling or thinking about traveling. I’m definitely always on the lookout for a new adventure. Although I’ve only been to three continents, it is my goal to make it to every continent. </p> <p>I’ve also been known to dabble in photography and graphic design, mostly because I've been completely inspired to do so by some of my professors at the Univerisity of Florida.</p>
